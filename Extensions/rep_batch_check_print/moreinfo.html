<b>How To Use This Report To Print And Update Checks</b>
<ol>
<li>
When entering check payments in FrontAccounting to be printed by this report,
add the Check Replacement String (default: @@@@) to the payment "Memo:" field.
This flags the check "To Be Printed" and will be replaced by the actual check number when the checks are printed.
</li>
<li>
Run this report.
Do a dry run first to review the PDF.
If not all the checks that you expected to print appear,
use Bank Inquiry and examine the memo field for the replacement string.
Edit the checks as necessary.
</li>
<li>
Once the PDF is correct, load the checks and print.
</li>
<li>
If the checks print okay, set Update Check Numbers to "Yes" and rerun the report.
This updates the checks by replacing the Check Replacement String
with the check number in the "Memo:" field.
</li>
<li>
If some checks failed to print properly due to printer problems,
use the Ending Check Number field to limit the update to the first
checks that printed fine.
Then run the report again to print the remainder of the checks.
</li>
</ol>
FUTURE: This report needs a popup to select/unselect the checks,
which would add/remove the Check Replacement String in the payments.
