Name | Getter | Setter | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**card_nonce** | getCardNonce() | setCardNonce($value) | **string** | A card nonce representing the credit card to link to the customer.  Card nonces are generated by the &#x60;SqPaymentForm&#x60; that buyers enter their card information into. See [Embedding the payment form](/payment-form/payment-form-walkthrough) for more information.  __Note:__ Card nonces generated by digital wallets (e.g., Apple Pay) cannot be used to create a customer card. |
