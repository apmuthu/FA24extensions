**cursor** | getCursor() | setCursor($value) | **string** | Include the pagination cursor in subsequent calls to this endpoint to retrieve the next set of results associated with the original query.  See [Pagination](/basics/api101/pagination) for more information. | [optional] 
**limit** | getLimit() | setLimit($value) | **int** | A limit on the number of results to be returned in a single page. The limit is advisory - the implementation may return more or fewer results.
